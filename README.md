# Sample App

This is sample Kotlin cross-platform starter app using [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com).

It is written using the new Kotlin DSL for Gradle. 
The standard libGDX Groovy scripts have been rewritten for Kotlin.

The iOS support is via the [Mobi fork](http://robovm.mobidevelop.com) of RoboVM, due to the lack of response from [Intel/Migeran's MOE](https://multi-os-engine.org).

This project was created from scratch, borrowing liberally from libGDX's usual starter buildscripts and the Gradle/Kotlin community at large.
